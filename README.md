# Mock Dinosaur Job Application with Vue.js
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a single-page app that uses Vue.js.  It's a mock job-application page that uses two-way data binding.

## Motivation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a required drill as part of the Galvanize Web Development Immersive program.  I like that it uses Vue.js, and it is one of three drills that helped me in getting experience in Vue.js.
